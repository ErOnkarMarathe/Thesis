Thesis topic: Machine Learning for Wall-Resolved Large Eddy Simulations (WRLES)

Project overview:
This work investigates the use of neural networks (NN) trained on wall-resolved large eddy simulation (WRLES) data at selected Reynolds numbers (Re). The trained NN is then tested using input from wall-modeled LES (WMLES) to predict wall shear stress for Reynolds numbers that were not part of the training set. The aim is to evaluate the networkâ€™s ability to generalize and accurately predict wall shear stress across different flow regimes and simulation data types.
