Thesis topic: Implementation and validation of a supervised machine learning Wall Model for WMLES into the spectral element flow solver Neko

Project overview:
This work investigates the use of neural networks (NN) trained on wall-resolved large eddy simulation (WRLES) data at selected Reynolds numbers (Re). The trained NN is then tested using input from wall-modeled LES (WMLES) to predict wall shear stress for Reynolds numbers that were not part of the training set. The aim is to evaluate the network’s ability to generalize and accurately predict wall shear stress across different flow regimes and simulation data types.
